# Feature Ideas for Markdown Playground

Here are three feature ideas to enhance the Markdown Playground application:

## 1. Theming

**Concept:** Allow users to switch between different visual themes to suit their preferences.

**Details:**
*   Implement a theme switcher with options like "Dark" (current), "Light", and maybe a "Solarized" or "Dracula" theme.
*   This can be achieved by defining different color palettes in CSS variables and creating a toggle component to switch between them.
*   The selected theme could be saved in the user's `localStorage` to be remembered across sessions.

**Benefits:**
*   Improves user experience by allowing personalization.
*   Enhances accessibility, as some users may find a light theme easier to read.

## 2. Markdown Cheatsheet

**Concept:** Provide a quick reference guide for Markdown syntax directly within the application.

**Details:**
*   Add a small, toggleable panel or a modal that displays a cheatsheet with common Markdown syntax (e.g., headings, lists, links, images, code blocks).
*   The cheatsheet could be interactive, allowing users to click on an item to insert a template into the editor.

**Benefits:**
*   Makes the application more beginner-friendly.
*   Improves workflow by providing a quick reference without needing to leave the site.

## 3. Cloud Sync / Storage

**Concept:** Allow users to save their markdown documents and access them later.

**Details:**
*   **Phase 1 (Local Storage):** Start by saving the user's current document in `localStorage`. This would allow the text to persist even if the user accidentally closes the tab.
*   **Phase 2 (Cloud Storage):** For a more robust solution, integrate with a cloud service like Firebase (Firestore) or a similar backend. Users could potentially sign in to save and sync their documents across devices.

**Benefits:**
*   Prevents loss of work.
*   Adds significant value by turning the playground into a more serious tool for writing and storing notes.
